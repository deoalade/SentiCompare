I haven't received my code where do I find it I haven't received email with my code either I also work in a Supermarket
A rotten app which I suppose is all one can expect when one considers that it was probably designed by a politically correct ex university idiot. UNINSTALLED
Huawei p30 - it will not allow users to progress beyond the continue button on the entry screen
been to plenty of places in yorkshire nhs track and trace doesnt scan and doesnt help finding the correct track and trace app
Doesnt work says need a number to start app up but never recieved one neither has alot of friends
"I've a code but can't get past the first page to enter it! Is my phone too old? It is a Galaxy J3. My phone is Version 9, no idea whether it is BLE 4 or above. I give up!"
September 2020. Available in only 2 UK locations. Let that sink in.......
"I'm a Newham resident and visited Bristol at the weekend, the QR code scanner didn't work anywhere. I understand the scanner only works in Newham and the Isle of wight, but what's the point in building it like that? surely people will travel to other and cities and want to check in anywhere. Also wh..."
"The QR scanner doesn't work at any venue I have tried on the isle of wight, so I cant actually sign in anywhere!! It makes it a pointless feature. The rest of the app works as the old app did, which is great. Please sort ot the QR code scanner"
"Unable to run, requires some ""code"". I'll give this app more stars when it gets a bit more user-friendly but uninstalling it for now."
"It's not even out properly yet when other countries have already made an app that works, so disappointing and careless."
Complete plandemic
I am an Isle of Wight resident. I think my wife may have binned my code. Can I get a new one?
I have an LG and it won't download.
"It's very difficult to scan the barcode, after 7 attempts I gave up, no point in having the app if this is the case. I will try again in a different venue"
When will this be rolled out nationally in England? I see it's still only for isle of Wight and a borough of London- yet on BBC news Love Island stars are being paid to promote it ?
"Easy to install on Samsung S7 and S10 but could benefit with more functionality, especially checking into locations. Currently the app relies on establishments signing up to and displaying a QR code. It would be helpful if we could manually input locations for places that haven't yet signed up. This..."
"This is dumb, If you truly wanted this system to work and more people to use it then why not just make it so it just works. Why the f do I have to get a unique code? Is ridiculous. Point of failure right at the start. Why can't I just simply use my NHS number? Uninstalling."
"'world beating' as long as you live in Isle of White or Newham. Ireland's got an app, why doesn't the rest of the UK? Maybe Dominic's gone back to Barnard Castle to test his eyes so can't give Boris the nod to release it."
QR check in code never works
"Pretty pointless at the minute and won't load on my new phone. I don't know how much the UK government have spent on this so far, but by the time they get it right it will no longer be relevant. The developer had since contacted me (below) but to no avail. My phone is running way ahead of the spend ..."
This app wont allow me past the first page. Continue icon does not work so I cannot enter the code. Have reinstalled app several times. App support has given no help although I reported the problem . My phone is Samsung J3. It works on my husband's phone which is older
Can't check in. Poor as the last version
"Boris promised us a ""world beating app"" on 20th May by the end of June. It is now the end of AUGUST and we are still waiting for this ""world beating app""."
Will only install on one of my phone's. Is it possible to install on my work phone too?
"App doesn't work with the galaxy fold, get a message advising that my phone is a tablet"
I've got it INSTALLED but there is no OPEN box to open it. I cannot find it in my list of apps. It doesn't show up on my app pages. I have a Unique Code but I have NOT been asked for it during the very simple installation. I've read everything on this site page - there is nothing about using the Uni...
"Easy to download, user friendly, just downloaded the apps. So far, I am really impressed with the 'latest advice' column. It makes assessing government information on travel and other areas easily accessible"
"Just installed the App as i am an NHS volunteer, first thoughts are its laid out well, and easy to use , some good tabs one for latest information and there is one for checking in to a venue which is a good feature so far all looks good."
Useless thus far. When will it go live for the general populous so that the UK can have something other countries have had for a long time?
"Easy to use, clear about the permissions and needs, straight forward to install and set up."
"I'm an NHS Volunteer Responder and have been invited to trial the app. Download and set up was easy, I was emailed an access code for the trial which I needed to input, plus my postcode. After that it's very easy to follow and the instructions are really simple - the contact proximity tracing looks ..."
"Seems easy to navigate and intuitive. Will have to see how effective it is in terms of tracing/ notifications. I'm not sure it's a good idea to show people the risk level of their area. It could easily lead people to become complacent and not follow the rules on the basis they in a low risk area, de..."
I couldn't install the app and it won't download get me onto the homepage
"It wouldn't download, I tried numerous times but to no avail. I have the latest up-to-date android. And I see only 10k downloads won't give an accurate figure anyway. Thanks anyway"
"Limited availability, basically useless for most"
Need more places to actually have the NHS QR code to scan. At the moment nowhere I have been has had a NHS QR code to scan across Newham. So the app doesn't know where I have been. Therefore this makes it fairly redundant. I leave my details with places I visit but that has no impact on what the off...
Why does this not include Scotland? Last time I checked we were unfortunately still one nation!
Didnt realize it was a localised app for a specific area hence why I can o ly give a neutral review as I was not actually.able to use it.
"If the app is Bluetooth,it should follow you outside of the borough of Newham"
We can't even get the app right
So we've all got the option to turn on Covid-19 and have had for about a month? But by the looks of it there are 3 apps none of them can be used! What are we ment to do? More work for NHS if we can't use the apps.
When will this be available for all? I work in Newham but can't download the app. Shouldn't this app be expedited for everyone by now?
Disappointed to find this is for certain people as the app is trialing. Downloaded after watching How to avoid a 2nd wave on TV where it is showed as a new 2nd attempt at track and trace. Not complaining to app but with all this mixed info around its no wonder we are all confused. How do I become a ...
"Before the school starts, I would like to suggest, this spp should available for whole UK"
Does not open. Says only available for Isle of Wight.
When is this available to the rest of the UK?
"Apparently this app is only available to volunteers, isle of Wight. Where can I find the app that the general public use.Just watched a programme about the second wave on channel 4 which is was mentioned as an updated new 2nd app. How are we supposed to comply if the tecs not there? Mrs Richards"
QR code in location visited was not scanning on this app.... visited my gym and the QR code did work.... can't wait for this to be more usable across London and UK
This app is useless. Needs some sort of code to even function. What is the point of a contact trace app you can't even use?!
"Installed and runs without any drama on my Huawei P20 Mate Pro. There's not a lot of interaction possible - I'm yet to come across a 'check-in' QR code. Battery usage is negligible (0.35%) I had to take a few steps to allow the app. to run in the background, without being killed, but that's somethin..."
None of the codes in my letter are valid. I am an isle of Wight resident with a 2 year old smartphone.
When is this app be8ng made available to the general public?
"I just had an Instagram advert promote this app which isn't available for general use, doesn't work anyway and is a privacy nightmare."
"Would like to download the app, apparently I need a code, and only available currently in Northern Ireland?"
It won't take the first part of my postcode and I'm with an invite.. i put e1 and it accepted it but my postcode is e13 and it won't accept it. Now its freezing and I can't get out of this
"Downloaded the app, it does not work. I try pressing ""Continue"" on the first screen, but nothing happens."
Can't get through
Will not let me check in anywhere. Always says something went wrong
"Not a great start. Followed the procedure to install the app, didn't get the usual option tho open it once installed as usually happens with any newly installed apps but it says it's installed but I can't find it anywhere on my phone at all. Even using the search function in apps under settings draw..."
Doesn't work on Huawei P30 pro
Downloaded but says I cannot use this app.... I have an invitation letter though.
App easy to use. Not sure if it has effected my Nike running club app since loading
Jason Curtis
Wast of time downloading the app because the code doesn't work pointless
A slick interface that is clear to understand with the option to disable/pause tracing functionality clearly marked. (Presumably for health workers that may be near diagnosed patients) Integration of the Google API makes battery impact non-existent. The location QR code scanner is a good feature for...
I would like to know when will this app be available in england. I am going on hoilday to isle of wight next month. I will be able to use the app. I would like a code please
"I am living in Newham area but I did not receive a code yet, not by post or email. Plus I am working as a care assistant ."
I can't download it on my parent's phones as it requires IOS 13.5 or higher. Shame that.
I don't have the most up to date smartphone which meant downloading app wasn't straight forward. Not sure how an older person who is more unsure with technology than me would cope. Also I put my postcode in the app but when I visited outside that area the tracker didn't follow me and couldn't change...
The app does not work. All I see is a blank white screen. I can provide details of my phone and a screenshot.
So far so good. Give me little more confident. Don't know why!?!?
Excellent
Still unusable. Was hoping I could use the app to scan a QR code at the last place we all ate out at. But only avaible to selected people with an invite. How can you test an app without people joining. I bet this one gets scrapped as well like the Isle of Wight one. Looks like it has potential but n...
"How is this STILL not available to the general public???? Really, really poor. Shambles from the start and still is. Costing us all our health and livelihoods ??"
Good
I have installed the app its saying I can't use the app because it either a company phone which is isnt or another app is running the same technology. Tell me why this is.
"Simple to install and use. I do have one question about the QR venue scanning- I couldnt see what sort of venues will be covered. Is this just pubs and restaurants, or will it cover hair dressers, shops, place of work etc. Essentially, do I need to be asking for every business premises I go into in ..."
We don't get any feedback
Not for UK
Pretty easy to use and not that difficult to understand. But the codes should be different for everyone in the country as it can be confusing using the same 5 codes for so many people.
"App was easy to download and set up using the code provided in my letter, its also good to be able to see the risk level in my area I'll update as I use the app"
It doesn't work I can't check into venues it's constantly stuck on my home post code even when I've been on holiday it also tells me I live in a high risk area when I don't all in all it doesn't work. I was only using official NHS qr code posters at various venues the answer above the answer below j...
"Easy to use, straight forward design. Now my challenge is to find a heavily Covid19 populated area, to see how the app actually works, all the bells and whistles etc..."
"Loses one star for incorrectly interpreting my comments and then sending pointless response. Download and install is simple but unless you have been allocated a one-time code, you will not be able to activate the app. Wording in the summary is wrong ""have been given a unique code to install the app""..."
"Apparently I need a code and I'm not being sent one, how do I get a code to use the app."
"downloaded as I work in hospitality and quite nervous about being in work, so wanted some reassurance if I do come into contact with someone. Apps not clear how you get the code to sign up."
"I'm British but live in a Covid high risk country (Spain) and thought I'd do my bit when visiting the UK just in case I have it without symptoms but later find out I have the virus. However, without the code (as I don't live in the UK) I can't log into this app and be tracked."
"I downloaded the app 3 times waited for emails 2 / 3 days and nothing, there is no place I could find to log an email or postal address Deleted"
"I tried using the T&T yesterday at a restaurant I visited. They had the QR code & I tried to scan it twice. I had a message cone up on the screen of my Samsung phone "" sorry, something went wrong"" felt kind of deflated that it was unsuccessful for me. First time I've been out socially since lock dow..."
Downloaded as NHS Volunteer Responder. Due to Post Code only using first part it says I am in a high risk area which is incorrect. The app needs to use more bespoke post codes ie the first digit of the second batch to be realistic for wider roll out. Submitted as a suggestion so email back advising ...
"Downloaded, installed. All worked ok. However two things. The key given is shown in email as 3digits-3digits but when entering the code the - does not appear automatically so spent ages trying to enter the - before I did without and it appeared as I entered the 4th digit. Also tried signing up to th..."
"Thought I would download as I work for NHS and going for a test today, so thought it would be a good thing to have. Asks for a code? What code? I've not been sent any letters or emails with a code? Looks like I can't use it which seems a bit misleading and pointless."
"Want to use but have no code, how do I get a code or is it only in iow."
I have downloaded the app and once I open it it asks you to continue but despite trying several attempts it will not let me continue
How do I get the code I installed the app today I would prefer the code to be sent by email.
I haven't got a code to use the app so it's not easy to use and it doesn't show you what it really means I only downloaded it for while I was at Isla write in case I got in contact with some one with the virus
"Tried to load it but it won't let me open, says I need a code and I haven't been sent one and yes I'm well past 18.... Thanks for your reply, found code and all sorted now"
"My wife used the first of the 4 codes for our household, yet none of the other 3 codes were valid when I tried to use them so unable to use the app. Additionally, the input box for the code clearly overwrites your keyboard settings as it prevents controls such as swiping on the keyboard to move betw..."
Can't register on my Huawei smart phone via Google playstore
"Incredibly easy to understand and set up, all working smoothly (note: I had a code to take part in the trial)"
Its asking for a code but I dont have one?
Tried to install cannot get past continue nor enter code given on letter.is it because i still have the old ap.
"Unable to download to my wife's Samsung J5 2016 phone. She would use the app if it was available to her, but she isn't going out to upgrade her phone just for an app. Not everyone can afford to upgrade to the latest phone just to load an app. If you want a true representation, this app should be ava..."
"Where is the code, no correspondence from any one any where Not very good is it"
How do I get my code?
Simple and straightforward to install and set-up only issue was I had initially missed the section in my NHS responder email. That was down to me not reading the full email. Maybe a follow up email to other NHS responders for just this invite might help attrack more downloads.
Downloaded the app...no code sent to access it. Don't waste your time ??
Confused as to why it needs an Invite code. How bad can it be if we aren't allowed to use it? Surely gathering more data and having the odd false positive alert/match is better than hiding it behind an invite system?
"Works on both android 7 and android 8 phones fine. Had to reinstall app after installing google services on the android 8 phone. Has better U.I and more info than previous trial app. Letter containing code arrived through our letterbox on the 15th, not the 14th."
"Downloaded... Opened... Welcome screen..... That's it!..... Nothing happens when you press, ""continue"". Uninstalled...... Tried again...... Still no response. Just sticks on the welcome screen"
I haven't received a unique code!
"Makes no sense. They ask you to type in a code and you get it via letter or email but when you download it, it doesn't ask for an email so they can email you a code. If they want people to use it then they need it to be MORE user friendly."
Easy to download and set up. Code worked first time and app provides access to lots of information. I am also now more aware of the risk level in my postcode area.
"As others have mentioned I too had no problems in finding the code, all people need to do is take their time and carefully read through any correspondence that's been sent and you'll find it's as easy as pie. All told it took less than 2 minutes to get everything downloaded, installed and activated ..."
"""unfortunately, you can't run this app"""
"Clowns, it's all over media that this is available so thought best install. It doesn't say in the description that it's invite only! As my wife is on the ""extremely high risk list"" it would be extremely helpful to have this especially when they expect the schools to open. Oh well having a competent ..."
"Previously rated 5 for ease of installing. Would now rate 0 if I could. Impossible to scan QR codes - ""something went wrong"" - and there is no option to check in manually. Very disappointing."
"Downloaded app and asked to add a code, which is supposed to be emailed. Still waiting for this 5 days later. Yes my email is correct Not in junk folder as suggested"
"Installed on Galaxy S7 no problem and set up very straight forward. Was concerned that location and bluetooth being on would be a serious battery drain, but in a 12hr period I still had 30% left... that's good enough for me. NHS volunteer responder, so that app running all the time as well."
I'm a voluntary responder ive download the track and trace app its easy and very clear to use and see. Tells me lots of information about latest news ect Very good app I say
"App installed due to being an Isle of Wight resident, but the island is popular destination for tourists and foreign students, should they not be given a code to enable their contacts to be traced too. This could be done with the ferries issuing codes when they board"
Why does it want my credit card details SCAM
Download ok but will not accept codes in the letter. Cannot get past 1st 4 numbers/letters. Very frustrating
"So far so good. Installed it a few days ago as a NHS responder. Having read about it from various media outlets in the past few months, I was a bit concerned about how much keeping Bluetooth on all the time will drain the battery but so far it hasn't resulted in any significant battery drainage. Ple..."
Works well on Motorola E6 plus
i want to use but dont have invite how can i get invite ime in stoke on trent so need this app
Downloaded easily enough and used the code given. However I had to uninstall and reinstall it and now can't reuse the code or obtain a new one. However your FAQ answers state that if you change your phone you can install the app on that with no problems - no mention that there might be an issue with...
"Downloaded easily. The passcode wouldn't accept the hyphen, but then I found it puts it in automatically. It would be useful to be able to change the postcode location to where you actually are. E.g. my home location is in Berkshire, but I'm visiting Yorkshire next week. Haven't seen many QR codes d..."
"Unable to put on work phone as I've already downloaded onto my private phone, I need it on my work phone as I visit lots of different properties each day, I don't take my private phone into work jobs"
How do we get a code? It seems a little bit strange that Aylesbury Vale / Milton Keynes isn't worth including. I thought that this was UK wide initiative.
can't start using unless you have received a magic unique code. brilliant.
No code to use the app.
"Unfortunately none of the invitation codes allocated to my household were considered valid so unable to use. Response from developer unhelpful as I was already aware of that information, and none of the codes I received had already been used by my household. I'd already submitted a technical problem..."
Easy to install and use. It would be good if you could be advised of the risk level in your current location as well as your home postcode. Those complaining that it does not work probably don't have an access code or are trying to use someone else's!
OK
Been trying for 2 hours solid to download onto my Samsung Galaxy j5. The previous app downloaded in seconds.. **** has now downloaded.
Download was simple. Looks good and easy to use. Reading the reviews it appears that some people having trouble have maybe not bothered to read that it requires a code and only available in certain areas. Perhaps this should be displayed more prominently at the top of the information to download the...
Downloaded and installed improved app. Opened and pressed continue but nothing happens so cannot put in code Original app worked fine.
Hi I download the app it's fine but its asking me for a special code but I haven't got one
Great
Installed but can't use because you need to be specially selected and given a code to input. Bloody daft!
So far so good. Nice clean design. Easy to navigate. Let's see how it does out in the wild..
I downloaded the app but no code to continue on it were will o find the code so for now I give 2 stars
"Installed app, where do I get my code to input into the app ??"
The fact it's invitation only. Downloaded it to find out I can't have. Half arsed government we have
What's the point this should be available nationally. Non of this enter the code rubbish. The English government think they are now playing a game.
How do you get the code to make it work this should be open to everybody not just a chosen few typical
"As good as the last one, doesn't work. Crashes out on loading on a Samsung Tab--s2. App installed but will not load. UK Government does it again, can't manage IT projects. Doesn't get to the point of offering me a code. Faulty app. The last one they said, oh doesn't work with tablets. Not a tablet. ..."
Did it cause my battery to run down? Took it off my phone before I used the app at all because my battery seemed to run down fast and I was suspicious that this was the cause.
It's asking for a unique code from a email or letting that being sent
Easy to download and use. Fingers crossed for a successful roll out. After reading other reviews I wasn't sure where my code was either it's easy to miss amongst all the text. If this was highlighted somehow it would help.
Downloaded easily & seems to load well.
Just installed the app. One question : where from do I get my unique code?
"Looks great to me, but can I alter my post code?"
No use without a code
Good to see NHS using the Google/apple system. Inspires some confidence that this will work. Like the UI design.
App downloaded quickly and easily. It gave me information on my local area risk level. Should be another useful tool to help keep my friends and family safe
"Installs perfectly, zero problems. Giving this a five to offset the gentleman who said it wasn't installed. Kindly learn how to use your phone (aka RTFM) before blaming any application. It's not rocket science, honestly ! If you can't see any app, including this one, it's because your phone will put..."
Only just installed the app. As a NHS Responder I'm apparently in one of the groups which can use the Track 'n' Trace app for now. I do agree with another reviewer regarding the email informing us of the availability of this app could've be a bit better organised. A bulleted order list of the steps ...
"Get message saying ""NHS Test and Trace keeps stopping"" doesn't even open"
Tells me is installed but not on phone. Can't get as far as putting the code I have been given in. Doesn't inspire confidence. It eventually downloaded and the code works. This needs to be slicker and quicker if people are going to be use it...people expect to get an app and use it immediately.
"The emails from the NHS could do a better job of highlighting the access codes, since they do waffle on quite a bit and we're all busy. Assuming you did read your email carefully and collected the one-time code, the app seems to work very nicely. The visual design is great."
Seems to work really well. Super simple setup. People stop giving it 1* because you don't have a signup code. That is not what the rating system is for.
"Not able to install ,code didn't work"
Where can I get a code? The instructions is not clear
